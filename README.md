# Air Taffic Data Analysis
This project is created to analyze the distribution of flights along altitude (0-500FL) in one FIR during one specific day(24h). 
The codes uploaded here include data processing and integrated plotting.
The result is 1.a graph to show the sum of number of flights along the time 2.a graph with subplots when click the point on the graph the detailed air traffic information of that time/ flight level can be shown
