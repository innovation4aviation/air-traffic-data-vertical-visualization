# Trajectory-Clustering
This project aims to complete a coarse trajectory clustering of overfights (whose departure/arrival points are out of FIR) in KZTL FIR.
The trajectory information of overflights is picked out as well as their corresponding entering/exiting FIR point.
The metric of trajectory clustering is haversine distance between entering&exiting points and the result is flight flows.
