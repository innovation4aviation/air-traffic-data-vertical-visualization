# Air Taffic Data Analysis
This project is created to analyze the distribution of flights along altitude (0-500FL) in one FIR during one specific day(24h). 
The codes uploaded here include data processing and integrated plotting.
The result is a graph with subplots and when click the point on the graph the detailed air traffic information of that time/ flight level can be shown
